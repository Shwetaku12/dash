
------------------------- Limitations and Potential Improvements -------------------------

# Limitations:
1. Complexity of Artistic Styles: The model may struggle with highly complex artistic styles that are not well-represented in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Dataset Size: CIFAR-10 is a relatively small dataset. For improved generalization, a larger and more diverse dataset of artworks could be used.

# Potential Improvements:
1. Transfer Learning: Utilize pre-trained models on larger image datasets for feature extraction, followed by fine-tuning on the artistic dataset.
2. Data Augmentation: Increase dataset diversity by applying data augmentation techniques during training (rotation, flip, zoom).
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization algorithms to enhance performance.
4. Ensemble Methods: Combine predictions from multiple models or model snapshots to improve robustness.
5. Attention Mechanisms: Incorporate attention mechanisms to allow the model to focus on specific regions, potentially capturing intricate artistic details better.
6. User Interaction: Implement user feedback loops for the model to learn and adapt to specific user preferences over time.

Overall, continuous experimentation and refinement are crucial for addressing limitations and enhancing the model's capabilities.
