Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch
This Python script implements neural style transfer using PyTorch. Neural style transfer involves applying the artistic style of one image (style image) to the content of another image (content image). The algorithm optimizes a target image to minimize the content difference with the content image and the style difference with the style image.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
matplotlib
numpy
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/neural-style-transfer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd neural-style-transfer
Install the required dependencies:

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
Usage
Load content and style images by specifying their file paths in the load_image function.
Specify the layers for content and style representation in the get_features function.
Set style weights, content weight, and other hyperparameters.

python neural_style_transfer.py
The script will iteratively optimize a target image to combine the content of the content image with the style of the style image.

Customization
Feel free to experiment with the following parameters to achieve different results:

style_weights: Adjust the weights for each style layer.
content_weight: The weight for the content loss.
style_weight: The weight for the style loss.
show_every: Control how frequently intermediate images are displayed during optimization.
steps: Number of iterations for optimizing the target image.
